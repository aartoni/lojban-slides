\section{Lojban properties}
\begin{frame}{Nice properties you have there}
    Lojban is a \textbf{logical}, \textbf{constructed}, \textbf{syntactically unambiguous} human language. It is fluently spoken by about 12--20 people~\cite{lojban:speakers}.

    The name ``Lojban'' itself is a compound formed from \emph{loj} and \emph{ban}, which are short forms of \emph{logji} (logic) and \emph{bangu} (language).

\begin{frame}{Constructed, logical, unambiguous}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{constructed}: that is, artificial, as opposed to a \textbf{natural language}.
        \item \textbf{syntactically unambiguous}: .
        \item \textbf{logic}: based on \textbf{predicate logic}, the only notable ones are Lojban and its predecessor: \textbf{Loglan}.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What's a language?}
    A \textbf{language} shouldn't be confused with the way we express it, that means that \textbf{signing} isn't a language (and no, you can't sign in Lojban yet~\cite{lojban:signing}).
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Constructed languages}
    % From here we already know a lot of things:
    %   - we are talking about a human language;
    %   - we are talking about a language that has been engineered for a specific purpose.
    In linguistics a \textbf{natural language} is any language that has evolved naturally in humans through \textbf{use} and \textbf{repetition} without conscious planning or premeditation (e.g., English, Chinese).
    % In linguistica, un linguaggio naturale Ã¨ un linguaggio evoluto naturalmente negli umani attraverso l'uso e la ripetizione non pianificata (e.g., English, Chinese).

    Natural languages have nothing to do with non-human intraspecific and interspecific communication (e.g., biocommunication).

    Examples of \textbf{constructed languages} include programming languages, Esperanto and Klingon.
    % We should have a Klingon speaker in the public
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Syntactically unambiguous}
    For each proposition we can build one and only \textbf{one parsing tree}.
    % As opposed to ordinary languages where you usually have a forest of parsing trees

    This is different from \textbf{lexical ambiguity} which pertains to a word or phrase having more than meaning in the language.
    % Lojban does prevent lexical ambiguity at word level but not at phrase level
